</div>

<p class="hx-mb-6 hx-text-lg hx-text-gray-500 dark:hx-text-gray-400">
Even as professional developers, it is extremely difficult to have all our knowledge intact and fresh when we need it.&nbsp;<br class="sm:hx-block hx-hidden" />We tend to forget what we have not used recently, that's how the brain works.
</p>

<p class="hx-mb-6 hx-text-lg hx-text-gray-500 dark:hx-text-gray-400">
We could define Pro Examples as a somewhat more detailed and comprehensive cheat sheet&nbsp;<br class="sm:hx-block hx-hidden" />for different technologies and programming languages.
</p>

<p class="hx-mb-6 hx-text-lg hx-text-gray-500 dark:hx-text-gray-400">
The project takes advantage of all the current power of AI for the generation of texts, but all the content is&nbsp;<br class="sm:hx-block hx-hidden" />curated by humans to avoid any erroneous or inaccurate content.
