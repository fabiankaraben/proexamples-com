## What is HTML?

HTML, or Hyper Text Markup Language, is the fundamental building block of the World Wide Web. It's a markup language, not a programming language, used to structure and define the content of web pages.

### Key Points of HTML

- **Structure and Content**: HTML uses tags to define elements like headings, paragraphs, images, links, tables, and forms, creating the basic structure and layout of a webpage.

- **Browser Rendering**: Web browsers interpret HTML code and render it visually, displaying the content in a user-friendly format.

- **Semantic Markup**: HTML5 introduced semantic elements that provide meaning and context to content, improving accessibility and search engine optimization.

- **Foundation for Web Development**: HTML works in conjunction with CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for styling and JavaScript for interactivity, forming the core technologies of web development.

- **Easy to Learn**: HTML has a relatively simple syntax, making it an accessible starting point for anyone interested in web development.

In essence, HTML is the backbone of any website, providing the structure and organization that allows browsers to display content in a meaningful way.
