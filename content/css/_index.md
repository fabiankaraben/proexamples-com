On this page we will talk about some interesting facts about CSS.

## What is CSS?

CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a language used to describe the presentation and visual appearance of web pages written in HTML (or other markup languages like XML). It controls elements like colors, fonts, layouts, spacing, and more, essentially styling the content defined by HTML.

### Key Points of CSS

- **Separation of Concerns**: CSS allows you to separate the structure (HTML) from the presentation (CSS), making it easier to maintain and update the design of a website.

- **Style Rules**: CSS uses style rules to apply styles to specific HTML elements or groups of elements. These rules define how those elements should be displayed.

- **Cascading and Inheritance**: CSS styles can cascade (apply in order of precedence) and inherit (pass down from parent elements to child elements), providing flexibility and control over the styling.

- **Selectors**: CSS uses selectors to target specific HTML elements or groups of elements based on their attributes, classes, IDs, or relationships.

- **Responsive Design**: CSS enables the creation of responsive websites that adapt their layout and styling to different screen sizes and devices.

In summary, CSS is the language that brings style and visual appeal to web pages, transforming the raw structure of HTML into a visually engaging and user-friendly experience.
